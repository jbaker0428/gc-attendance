An attendance system for the WPI Men's Glee Club.

Program features/plans/ideas:
 - The program, a local SQLite database, and a copy of the roster will sit in the Dropbox folder that is used for the attendance spreadsheet.
 - Read the attendance spreadsheet into the database.
 - Read the roster into the database.
 - Use the Google Calendar API to grab rehearsal dates/times and save those in the database.
 - Use the Gmail API to enter messages sent to the gc-excuse alias into the database.
 - Associate attendance records with rehearsals based on the date/time.
 - Attempt to associate gc-excuse messages with emails based on the date/time. It will probably suggest a rehearsal and the user will have to confirm the system's guess or choose another.
 - Almost everything is automated from here in terms of calculating if people are in good standing, etc. 
 - Maybe automatically send warning emails when people fall out of good standing?
